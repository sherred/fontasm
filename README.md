Bookmarklet for font adjustments

If you are using web fonts, you should be [using a web font loader](https://decadecity.net/talks/using-a-web-font-loader).

If you are doing that you will want to make some adjustments to your pre-web font loaded fonts to avoid the content jumping all over the place.

This bookmarklet helps you by overlaying a copy of an element without the web font on top of the original, so you can do the adjustments in the browser.

## Usage

Just copy the contents of bookmarklet.txt into a bookmark.
Click the bookmarklet and input a selector compatible with document.querySelectorAll
